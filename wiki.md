Functional 
Verb: walk

Non Functional 
Avderb: fast, integrity 

Integrity 
Data integrity 
Behavior integrity 
Security 

Modularization

Software architect 
Centralized: nodes to core
Distributed : node to nodes

Distributed pron
Higher processing power 
Low cost
Reliable 
Flexibility
Scalability 

Distributed cons
Sync overheads 
Communication overheads 
Network dependency 
Software complexity 
Security 



Block chain goal:
Integrity 
Functionality 

Peer-to-peer network:
Integrity 
Functionality
Trust

Like heading cats


Software system
Complete 
Consistent 
Correct 
These three will create trust

System Functionality in public peer-to-peer network:
Knowing node numbers 
Knowing node trustworthiness 

Peer-to-peer vulnerability 
Technical issue 
Malicious node

Block chain 
Comes in to solve the Byzantine generation problem  to make trust and Functionality in a public Distributed peer-to-peer network 

Step 5.
What is bloch chain:
Data structure 
Algorithm 
Technology collaboration
Peer-to-peer network 

Data structure:
How information placed at Blocks
Like info in book's pages, page numbers is the connection 

Algorithm:
Commands order.
In bloch chain set of commands that manages content info a democratic voting in peer-to-peer network. 

Technology collaboration 
Data structure 
Algorithm 
Encryption 
Security 
To have functionality in a peer-to-peer network 
So it will be the Ledgers دفتر کل

Cryptocurrency ownership management

Step 6
Ownership 

Trust and Functionality in peer-to-peer networks 

Ownership and witnesses 
Cross-examination 

Proof of ownership 
1.  Ownership Identification 
2. Asset identification 
3. The relation between property and ownership 

Ledgers books
Register books 

Security 
1. Identification: claim an identity 
2. Authentication: verify the claimed identity 
3. Authorization : giving access to specific resources based on verified identity 


Ledger books Functionality and features 
Document of ownership's proof
History of assets transformation 

Transparency and security 
Only trust people can change ownership im Ledger book

Block chain and ownership 
Groups od independent Ledgers books, and majority of these book info

Step 7
Double spending problem 
1. On digital stuff 
2. On Distributed peer-to-peer networks
3. Based on functional defects on peer-to-peer networks 

Defending the double spending 
1. Using a Physical Ledger books,  digital Ledger book
2. Using a Block chain 
3. Using a bloch chain technology suit 

Part 3 - Blockchain
Step 8 - Blockchain scheme

1. Ownership definition 
2. Ownership protection 
3. Saving barging and transaction data 
4. Preparing the Ledger book for distribution across an trustworthiness environment 
5. Ledger book distribution 
6. Adding new barging to the Ledger book
7. Decision making about which book is the main Ledger 

The above leverage the below
1. Tracking transaction history to recognize the owner 
2. Using AAA and hashing 
3. Using Blockchain data structure as Ledger book
4. Immutable and append-only Blockchain
5. Data definition and type of communications 
6. Authorized and approved transactions to add
7. Majority voting chooses main Ledger 


Step 9
1. Ownership definition 
+ inventory data 
+ Transaction data

Ownership documentation in Blockchain 
+ transfer ownership description 
+ preserving transaction history 

+ Transaction ownership description 
1. Sender's public key
2. Receiver public key
3. Amount 
4. Timestamp 
5. Transaction fee
6. Digital signature (proof of sender's authentication)
7. Smart contract or agreement reference 

+ preserving transaction history 
All transaction will save in historical  order on an immutable Blockchain database 

Transaction history integrity 
+ formal correctness 
+ Semantic correctness 
+ Authorization 

Step 10
Information Hashing 

Cryptographic hash function 
1. Fast creation 
2. Deterministic 
3. Pesudorandom
4. One-way
5. Collision resistant 

Information hash pattern 
1. Independent hashing 
2. Repeated hashing 
3. Combined hashing 
4. Sequential hashing 
5. Hierarchical hashing 


Step 11
Real world hashing 

Data comparison 
Instead of comparing data, compare data hashes 

Data changes 

Change-sensitive data reference 
Difference hash values consequences invalid hash

Data saving sensitive to change 
1. Chain-Linked data (the macro structure)
      + overall architecture of the Blockchain itself 
      + immutability
      + order
2. Merkle Tree ( the micro structure)
      + internal organization of transactions within a single block
      + family tree for the transaction 
      + Efficiency 
      + Security Verification 


Time-consulting computation 
Finding Blockchain hash puzzle by resources not knowledge 

Hash function 
1. Data without changes 
2. Nonce (will change)
3. Hash function 
4. Definitely level
