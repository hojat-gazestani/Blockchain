# session 1 to 4 concepts 

## Functional 
Verb: walk

## Non Functional 
Avderb: fast, integrity 

## Integrity 
+ Data integrity 
+ Behavior integrity 
+ Security 

## Modularization

## Software architect 
+ Centralized: nodes to core
+ Distributed : node to nodes

### Distributed pron
+ Higher processing power 
+ Low cost
+ Reliable 
+ Flexibility
+ Scalability 

### Distributed cons
+ Sync overheads 
+ Communication overheads 
+ Network dependency 
+ Software complexity 
+ Security 



## Block chain goal:
+ Integrity 
+ Functionality 

## Peer-to-peer network:
+ Integrity 
+ Functionality
+ Trust

## Like heading cats


## Software system
+ Complete 
+ Consistent 
+ Correct 
+ These three will create trust

## System Functionality in public peer-to-peer network:
+ Knowing node numbers 
+ Knowing node trustworthiness 

## Peer-to-peer vulnerability 
+ Technical issue 
+ Malicious node

## Block chain 
Comes in to solve the Byzantine generation problem  to make trust and Functionality in a public Distributed peer-to-peer network
