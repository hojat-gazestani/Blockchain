# Step 11- Real world hashing 

## Data comparison 
Instead of comparing data, compare data hashes 

## Data changes 

## Change-sensitive data reference 
Difference hash values consequences invalid hash

## Data saving sensitive to change 
1. Chain-Linked data (the macro structure)
      + overall architecture of the Blockchain itself 
      + immutability
      + order
2. Merkle Tree ( the micro structure)
      + internal organization of transactions within a single block
      + family tree for the transaction 
      + Efficiency 
      + Security Verification 


## Time-consulting computation 
Finding Blockchain hash puzzle by resources not knowledge 

Hash function 
1. Data without changes 
2. Nonce (will change)
3. Hash function 
4. Definitely level


Hello world!614 -> hash -> 00068A3C
